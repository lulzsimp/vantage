## poirot
- **Weaving spiders, come not here**

poirot was made with the idea to help you:
- [x] analyze test scores
- [x] compare test scores to some degree
- [ ] prepare for tests
- [ ] generate test practice papers on demand, understand, sort and comprehend questions
- [ ] generate/communalize? answers (long shot, wip)
- [ ] overcome the dogma of memorization that blinds most people (wip forever)

- poirot is currently invite only, as in it is so dumb and so rudimentary that I have to configure everything.
- once up and running, it would still be in beta testing well into november.
